                <h2>Riddhima Singh</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Riddhima Singh. I'm a student of ABESEC, and I want to get into the field of Information
                    Technology. I love writing, and my favorite thing is to create stories that bring people together.

                    I've been working on my portfolio since high school, but now it's time to show the world what I've
                    got. And that's why I've created this websiteâ€”so you can see my work so far and get a sense of who I
                    am as a writer.

                    If you'd like to learn more about me, check out my blog at codeasify.</p>
